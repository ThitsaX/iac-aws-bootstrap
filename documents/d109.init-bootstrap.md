# 9.  Initialise bootstrap terraform

Ensure 'bootstrap is the current directory:

```bash
cd bootstrap
```

Copy the `backend.hcl` file (which tells terraform where to find the existing configuration state  - i.e. in AWS) to the bootstrap folder:

```bash
cp ..\backend\backend.hcl .
```

Then initialise terraform in the bootstrap folder using the backend created in AWS:

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=./backend.hcl
```
