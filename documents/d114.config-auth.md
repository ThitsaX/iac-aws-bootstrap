# 14. Configuring Authentication
Record both the access key ID and the Secret Access key and keep them safe - ideally in some kind of Password manager like 1Password or LastPass (or any other such application). 

We will pass these keys as environment variables in gitlab-ci variable section. 

```bash
Get access key
# terraform output iac_user_key_id
"xxxxxxxxx"

Get secret key
# terraform output iac_user_key_secret
"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

You now have an access key for an administrative account
