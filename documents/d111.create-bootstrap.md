# 11. Creating the bootstrap

If there are no issues identified with the output plan, we can proceed to create the bootstrap environment.

Ensuring once again that the current directory is `bootstrap`, run the following command:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Once the plan output has been presented you will be asked if you want to continue. If all looks correct, type `yes`

If the apply fails with private key issues, the following commands must be issued (from the bootstrap directory):

```bash
chmod 600 ./.terraform/modules/bootstrap/modules/gitlab/ssh_keys/%tenant%-gitlab
terraform taint module.bootstrap.module.gitlab.aws_instance.gitlab-server
terraform taint module.bootstrap.module.gitlab.aws_instance.gitlab-ci
terraform apply
```
