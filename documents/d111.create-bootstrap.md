# 11. Creating the bootstrap

If there are no issues identified with the output plan, we can proceed to create the bootstrap environment.

Ensuring once again that the current directory is `bootstrap`, run the following command:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Once the plan output has been presented you will be asked if you want to continue. If all looks correct, type `yes`
