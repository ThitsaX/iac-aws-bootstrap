# 10. Plan the bootstrap deployment

We will execute a terraform plan to allow us to review the implementation of the bootstrap, as this will create our VPC, an initial set of Subnets, security groups, roles etc etc .

```bash
terraform plan
```

An example of the full output of the `plan` command can be seen [here](./d100.assets/1010.md) - it's a long read!

>Review this output carefully: will affect all future deployments!
