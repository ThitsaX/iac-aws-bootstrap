# 13.  Manually configure the GitLab CI-runner AWS account - This part is automated and not need to do manually

>The intent for subsequent releases of mojaloop-bootstrap is to apply more granular permissions to the gitlab_ci IAM user to restrict it to it’s specific tenant, however at the time of writing the need for customers to have functioning labs in a dedicated AWS account outweighs the need for allowing AWS accounts to be shared between tenants.   Storing Administrative AWS Credentials in GitLab for a production environment is **NOT** a reccomended practice!

## Configuraing the GitLab CI-Runner AWS account

1. Login to the AWS console using your administrative privileges.
2. Browse to Services\IAM\
    ![AWS IAM console](./d100.assets/1311.png)
3. Select the “Groups” page, and click on the “admin” group (not the checkbox) to open it:
    ![AWS IAM Groups](./d100.assets/1321.png)
4. From the admin group page, Click the “Add Users to Groups” button:
    ![Add users to group dialogue](./d100.assets/1331.png)
5. From the “Add Users” page, enter the tenant\customer name, followed by the -gitlab_ci (for example citigroup-gitlab_ci).   The requested IAM account should appear in the list - select the checkbox next to it, and press “Add Users to Group”

This enables the account to administer the AWS instance. As this account will be used by the gitlab_ci runner, we now need to provide a way for this gitlab to authenticate to the account.
