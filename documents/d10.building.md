# Building a Tenancy

![mojaloopIaC by ModusBox banner](./d10.images/000-banner.png)

This document details the steps that must be followed by an engineer to to create a tenancy, prior to deploying a mojaloop environment.

Whilst deployment (and re-deployment) of mojaloop environments is a highly automated process, at present this relies on the creation of a Tenancy - essentially a ‘company entity’ in AWS for hosting mojaloop, which contains the source-repository for each environment deployed within that tenancy.

This approach ensures that environments benefit fully from repeatable deployment - allowing multiple instances to be quickly created, re-created and destroyed in parallel without impacting each other, but consistent with each other.  At present the initial creation of the tenancy is still a somewhat manual process, however this will improve in future releases.

## Caveats

At present, a Tenancy is designed to operate within a single AWS region.   Whilst a tenancy or an environment can be built to span multiple AWS regions, this level of deployment is currently out-of-scope of this document.

At the time of writing, environments deployed in this manner are not validated for production use - this is not a supported use case in this release.

## Pre-requisites

This guide has been tested with the following software installed on the users workstation:

- aws-cli v2
- terraform v0.12.29   -  _note:  using any other version of Terraform will result in statefile incompatibilities and is o be avoided._
- git version 2.17.1
- ansible 2.9.7

This guide assumes a *nix command line (eg. BASH) is being used for deployment.

## Preparation

Collect the data from the Mojaloop Platform request form. In this scenario it provides the following data

|  Company name:                   |  Domain name:                      |  Names of Envs needed:           |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|   ACME Company                   |  acme.tips-lab.live                |  dev                             |
|                                  |                                    |  test                            |
|                                  |                                    |  prod                            |

This document assumes an AWS Account has already been created for this customer, and that you are familiar with logging in with your IAM user account, both to the console and AWS CLI.

## Creating a customer Tenancy

MBX-Mojaloop environments are designed to be deployed within an MBX-Tenancy.  Whilst this require somes additional preparation when onboarding a new customer, this method provides reliable automation of environmental upgrades, development, testing, rollback, etc etc.

A completed Tenancy will result in a local filesystem consisting of a backend folder, a bootstrap folder, and folders git-cloned for each deployed environment repository - see the illustration.

### 1. IAM User Permissions

Validate that you IAM user has the following highlighted permissions

![IAM Permisions](./d10.images/0110.png)

### 2. Create an AWS Hosted DNS Zone (Route53)

- Login to the console and select the Route53 service
- If necessary Register the domain name requested:
  - Go to `Registered domains` and click on `Register Domain`.  
   ![Registered Domains page](./d10.images/0210.png)

- Setup the zone
  - Go to `Hosted zones` and click on `Create Hosted Zone`
  ![Hosted Zones Page](./d10.images/0220.png)
  - Click on `Create Hosted Zone` and complete the form that is displayed
  ![Hosted Zones Form](./d10.images/0223.png)
  - Keep the Type as `“Public Hosted Zone”`.
  - Click `Create`

If you did have the register the domain, you will need to take a copy of the NS records for the hosted zone and update the Registered Domain with NS records for the created Hosted Zone.

![Registered Domain Page](./d10.images/0228.png)

### 3. Create a Local Workspace

It is important to create a dedicated local workspace for each Tennant, as the file paths and structure will directly relate to the deployment.

Failure to follow the directory structure instructions throughout this doc WILL result in deployment issues later in the process - and the whole document may need to be repeated-from-scratch.

```bash
$ mkdir acme
$ cd acme
$
```

![Local Workspace Folder Structure](./d10.images/0335.png)

You should now have the folder structure illustrated here.

### 4. Clone the AWS-Backend repo

The code in this GitHub repository quickly and consistently sets up a Terraform State Store in the Tennants AWS account, in the selected region.  Enter the following command to clone the repository from GitHub to a local folder called “bootstrap”:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:modusintegration/iac-aws-backend.git backend
Cloning into 'iac-aws-backend'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 15, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (15/15), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
remote: Total 15 (delta 3), reused 11 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (15/15), 8.82 KiB | 8.82 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (3/3), done.
$
```

![Local Workspace Updated Folder Structure](./d10.images/0410.png)

Your folder structure should have been updated as illustrated here.

### 5. Setting up AWS credentials

In this example, a profile has been selected called “tips-sandbox”:

```bash
$ aws configure list-profiles 
        default
        my-account
        woccu-workbench
        tips-sandbox
        mojaloop-advocacy
        product-workbench

$ export AWS_PROFILE=tips-sandbox
```

### 6. Initialise the Terraform backend

This prepares and configures Terraform ready to create the new terraform backend state in AWS:

```bash
cd backend 
terraform init
```

[Full Results can be seen here](./d10.images/0610.md)

### 7. Create the Terraform remote-state file

Run `terraform apply`,  followed by providing:

- the tenant (customer) name
- the AWS region their environments will run in. (See Caveat 1)

```bash
$ terraform apply
      var.tenant
          Tenant name, lower case and without spaces.
          Enter a value: acme

      var.region
          AWS region
          Enter a value: eu-west-1
  ```

[Full Results can be seen here](./d10.images/0710.md)

### 8. Create the boostrap

Move from the “backend” directory back into the “acme” directory. Create a bootstrap directory:

```bash
cd ..   # to acme dir
mkdir bootstrap
```

![Local Workspace Updated Folder Structure](./d10.images/0810.png) This should result in the folder structure illustrated here.

Using the editor software of preference (vim is generally used in this document, but nano, vsCode, blueFish etc are all perfectly acceptable) create `bootstrap/main.tf`.

It needs to be populated with the following contents of
(<https://github.com/modusintegration/mojaloop-bootstrap/blob/master/examples/acme/main.tf>)

### 9.  Initialise bootstrap terraform

Ensure 'bootstrap is the current directory:

```bash
cd bootstrap
```

Then initialise terraform in this folder using the backend created in AWS:

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=../backend/backend.hcl
```

[Full Transcript of running this command can be seen here](./d10.images/0910.md)

### 10. Plan the bootstrap deployment

We will execute a terraform plan to allow us to review the implementation of the bootstrap, as this will create our VPC, an initial set of Subnets, security groups, roles etc etc .

```bash
terraform plan
```

An example of the full output of the `plan` command can be seen [here](./d10.images/1010.md) - it's a long read!

>Review this output carefully: it will affect all future deployments!

### 11. Creating the bootstrap

If there are no issues identified with the output plan, we can proceed to create the bootstrap environment.

Ensuring once again that the current directory is `bootstrap`, run the following command:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Once the plan output has been presented you will be asked if you want to continue. If all looks correct, type `yes`

>The current release contains a bug that prevents the GitLab_runner component from fully deploying. A manual step is included in this document in its stead. This will be resolved in a future release, but at present, the bootstrap template may finish applying with the following error state:

If the apply fails with private key issues, the following commands must be issued (from the bootstrap directory):

```bash
chmod 600 ./.terraform/modules/bootstrap/modules/gitlab/ssh_keys/%tenant%-gitlab
terraform taint module.bootstrap.module.gitlab.aws_instance.gitlab-server
terraform taint module.bootstrap.module.gitlab.aws_instance.gitlab-ci
terraform apply
```

### 12. Creating a Wireguard connection

See [this guide](./d20.wireguard_setup.md) to implementing and supporting wireguard.

### 13.  Manually configure the GitLab CI-runner AWS account

>The intent for subsequent releases of mojaloop-bootstrap is to apply more granular permissions to the gitlab_ci IAM user to restrict it to it’s specific tenant, however at the time of writing the need for customers to have functioning labs in a dedicated AWS account outweighs the need for allowing AWS accounts to be shared between tenants.   Storing Administrative AWS Credentials in GitLab for a production environment is **NOT** a reccomended practice!

### 13. Configuraing the GitLab CI-Runner AWS account

1. Login to the AWS console using your administrative privileges.
2. Browse to Services\IAM\
  ![AWS IAM console](./d10.images/1311.png)
3. Select the “Groups” page, and click on the “admin” group (not the checkbox) to open it:
  ![AWS IAM Groups](./d10.images/1321.png)
4. From the admin group page, Click the “Add Users to Groups” button:
  ![Add users to group dialogue](./d10.images/1331.png)
5. From the “Add Users” page, enter the tenant\customer name, followed by the -gitlab_ci (for example citigroup-gitlab_ci).   The requested IAM account should appear in the list - select the checkbox next to it, and press “Add Users to Group”
  ![Adding users to a group](./d10.images/1341.png)

This enables the account to administer the AWS instance. As this account will be used by the gitlab_ci runner, we now need to provide a way for this gitlab to authenticate to the account.

### 14. Configuring Authentication

1. If you aren’t already - Login to the AWS console using your administrative privileges.
2. Browse to `Services\IAM\`  as before.
3. Select `“Users”` and enter the name of the gitlab_ci account  in the form `%tenantname%-gitlab_ci` (for example `citigroup-gitlab_ci`) and when the acount appears in the list, click it’s name (**NOT** the checkbox)
  ![Adding users to a group](./d10.images/1431.png)
4. Once the account summary is displayed, select the “Security Credentials” page, and “Create Access Key”:
  ![Adding users to a group](./d10.images/1441.png)

  > Record both the access key ID and the Secret Access key in the password safe - most likely in the 1Password vault created for this customer/tenant: (they will be needed during the GitLab setup)

5. ![Adding users to a group](./d10.images/1444.png)

Congratulations - you now have an access key for an administrative account

### 15. Setup Gitlab

1. create root password
2. create first admin user
3. login as admin user and create IaC group
4. Put in group CI/CD variables

|         Variable           |       Description                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG```   | This is available in 1Password / infra-devops vault / “Docker Hub IaC Auth”                       |
| ```AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID```    | Use the “gitlab_ci” user access key ID recorded in the previous step.                             |
| ```AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY```| Use the “gitlab_ci” user access key secret recorded in the previous step.                         |
| ```BUCKET```               | Bucket name can be confirmed from AWS S3 console - will be in the syntax %tennant%-mojaloop-state |
| ```GITHUB_SSH_KEY```       | CI SSH key found in 1Password                                                                     |
| ```TF_VAR_tenant```        | The value used in the tenant variable                                                             |
| ```TF_VAR_bucket```        | The value created by the backend creation process. Value can be found in the bucket variable in the `backend.hcl` file |
| ```NEXUS_IP```             |  IP address of the Nexus service                                                                  |
| ```NEXUS_PORT```           | Port number of the Nexus service                                                                  |
